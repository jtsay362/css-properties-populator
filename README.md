CSS Properties Populator

This Ruby project creates a Semantic Data Collection Changefile that contains
documentation for CSS properties, at-rules, pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes,
 value types, and general info.

To run:

  bundle install
  ruby main.rb -d

should create the file css_properties.json.bz2, which can be uploaded to
Solve for All as a Semantic Data Collection Changefile.
